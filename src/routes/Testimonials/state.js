        Dear Prospective Parent,
        <br/><br/>This letter is to affirm our highest endorsement of Zoila ("Tia") Chang as your child's
        daycare provider.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoila cares very deeply about her children and we have greatly benefited from
        having our
        daughter at First Steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;She started when she was three months and stayed with Zoila until she
        turned 3 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our daughter loved spending her days with Tia Zoila and the other children,
        sometimes making it difficult to pick her up at the end of the day because she didn&#39;t want to leave.

        Dear Prospective Parent,
        <br/><br/>This letter is to affirm our highest endorsement of Zoila ("Tia") Chang as your child's daycare
        provider.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoila cares very deeply about her children and we have greatly benefited from
        having our daughter at First Steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;She started when she was three months and stayed with
        Zoila until she turned 3 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our daughter loved spending her days with Tia Zoila and
        the other children, sometimes making it difficult to pick her up at the end of the day because she
        didn&#39;t want to leave.
        <br/><br/>Zoila provides age-appropriate care and stimulation for infants and toddlers and helped
        immensely in our daughter&#39;s social and cognitive growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time Our daughter
        entered pre-school, she had been potty trained for over a year, could recognize most letters of the
        alphabet, could count to 20, speak in clear full sentences in English, understand and communicate
        several phrases in Spanish, and was socially and emotionally well-adjusted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her transition
        to preschool was seamless.
        <br/><br/>Zoila is meticulously organized but also very flexible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to my wife's
        travel schedule and my occasional unpredictable days, Zoila has always been very accommodating in
        allowing the occasional early drop-off or late pick-up when necessary, and this has been incredibly
        helpful to us.
        <br/><br/>Most importantly, Zoila provides a strong sense of community amongst the families
        attending First Steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;We all enjoy catching up with each other at the Friday evening
        birthday parties that Zoila holds for the children and their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several recently
        graduated families still attend these parties even though some of these children are in elementary
        school now.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoila also holds an annual barbecue in the summer, which is widely attended by her
        graduates - some of whom are in high school! The attendance at these events are a clear testament to
        how much Zoila is adored by everyone who is part of the First Steps family.
        <br/><br/>Leaving your child with Zoila is like leaving him/her with a trusted family member, but
        also with someone who provides a rigor and a standard for childhood development that comes with an
        experienced childcare professional.
        <br/><br/>We cannot say enough great things about Tia Zoila and First Steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have
        any further questions, please feel free to contact us.
        <br/><br/>Sincerely,
      </p>

        Dear Prospective Parent,
        <br/><br/>Congratulations on your little one!&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are meeting with Zoila, you are
        probably
        nearing the end of your childcare search.
        <br/><br/>We love Zoila and feel so lucky to have found her.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were looking for a
        bilingual
        English/Spanish, play-based program, and a warm, nurturing environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not want
        strict
        schedules, high turn over, or academic programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;We toured dozens of daycares (a necessary
        evil

        food was a total bonus.

        Dear Prospective Parent,
        <br/><br/>Congratulations on your little one!&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are meeting with Zoila, you are
        probably nearing the end of your childcare search.
        <br/><br/>We love Zoila and feel so lucky to have found her.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were looking for a

        necessary evil in this beautiful city of ours) and My First Steps was our top choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
        homemade organic food was a total bonus.
        <br/><br/>Our son has been there since he was three months old, and Zoila has lovingly guided us
        through all our first-time-parent anxieties, fevers, teething, night wakings, weaning, you name
        it.&nbsp;&nbsp;She took videos of his first attempts at crawling and helped me decipher some of his
        Spanglish babbles.
        <br/><br/>'Tia' was his third word, after 'Dada' and 'Mama'.
        <br/><br/>Besides an exceptionally loving, calm, and nurturing environment, I have loved the way
        Zoila
        really 'follows the child.' She does not have any set curricula, but she is highly attuned to and
        supportive of the kids' multifaceted interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;When they go on a puzzle binge, she
        orders ten new puzzles to keep them interested.&nbsp;&nbsp;When they start building pillow forts, she
        stocks up on pillows of all sizes and Colors.&nbsp;&nbsp;When they start singing 'Twinkle Twinkle,'
        she
        teaches them the Spanish version.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is a keen observer of children, and consistently
        offers
        appropriate materials to engage and encourage their natural curiosity.
        <br/><br/>Now my son is almost two years old, talking up a storm, nearly out of diapers, and a
        veggie
        connoisseur - all thanks to Zoila.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tia is still helping steer all of us toward sanity by
        sharing discipline strategies, recommending developmentally appropriate toys, and even helping him
        transition to preschool (sob!).&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't even want to think about where we would be
        without her loving, experienced guidance.
        <br/><br/>After two years with our beloved Tia, I am honored to give her my highest
        recommendation.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
        <br/><br/>Warmly,

        Hello Parents,

        lucky day!&nbsp;&nbsp;You have been granted the GOLDEN TICKET.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seize the moment, because you may
        never ever find a daycare provider of this caliber again.
        <br/><br/>The children call Zoila “Tia” (Spanish for 'auntie'), and she really does become part of
        the family.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoila cares deeply about the children; she nurtures them and provides them with a
        safe
        yet fun environment.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a second home for the kids.
        <br/><br/>Tia believes that routines are important for the children and ensures they follow a steady
        routine
        of educational activities, play time, nap time, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our son spent many hours reading, playing
        puzzles, and talking to Tia and the other children.&nbsp;&nbsp;He learned his numbers, colors, and many
        other
        things in both English and Spanish.&nbsp;&nbsp;He even learned to use the potty – he was out of diapers at
        12
        months thanks to Zoila.
        <br/><br/>Zoila also takes care of the children's nutritional needs: she makes fresh bread, provides
        organic fruits for snacks, and home-cooked meals for lunch every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;No junk food, sugary
        sweets,
        or processed foods.&nbsp;&nbsp;The children eat the best food here...&nbsp;&nbsp;there will be days when you
        come to pick up your child and get jealous that the food you are smelling is not for you.
        <br/><br/>We are going to miss sending our son to Tia's house.&nbsp;&nbsp;She does not provide a
        daycare, she provides an extended family.&nbsp;&nbsp;We love her.
        <br/><br/>All the best,
      </p>

        Zoila has been caring for our now twenty month old daughter since she was six months old.&nbsp;&nbsp;We
        continue to be impressed with Zoila and her family.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoila is loving, honest, dedicated, and
        patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are confident that Zoila is taking amazing care of our daughter - she eats full,
        healthy meals (she often does not have much of an appetite left for dinner), she is learning to count to ten
        in Spanish and Chinese, and she now says "gracias" (thank you) regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we drop our
        daughter
        off, we feel like we are taking her to a close family or friend's house.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoila exudes warmth
        and compassion, and it is clear that she truly loves taking care of children.

        up.&nbsp;&nbsp;She cooks home-made foods for them and feed them with lots of vegetables and
        fruits.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is plenty of space indoor and out at the garden for them to explore, not to mention
        lots of great educational toys for kids of different ages.&nbsp;&nbsp;She plays with them, introducing them
        to
        books, music and good manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;She generously organizes birthday and holiday parties for every
        family to enjoy.&nbsp;&nbsp;When we are late from work to pick up our son, Zoila and her family is very
        accommodating and we are totally stress-free.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her family has been very supportive and our son
        likes
        them very much.&nbsp;&nbsp;He grew up happily and healthily in My First Steps Daycare and it is always
        difficult to get him out of the Daycare when it is time to go home.&nbsp;&nbsp;We maintain close contact
        with
        other kids and families even they had left the daycare now.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have so much love and confident to
        Zoila that when our twin babies were three months old, we let them join the big family and have fun growing
        up with other kids there.&nbsp;&nbsp;We are very grateful to have Zoila taking care of our sons.

        My son attended My First Steps Daycare from July 2007, (when he was 4 months old) through almost May 2008,
        when he turned one year old.&nbsp;&nbsp;We left the daycare because we returned to our home country,
        Argentina.&nbsp;&nbsp;At Zoila's place, our son received the proper stimulation to help him develop
        motor,
        auditory and tactile skills; Zoila achieved this largely by giving him the space to explore his
        curiosity.&nbsp;&nbsp;He was also introduced to life enrichment skills such us sharing, patience, and most
        importantly - love.
        <br/><br/>
        We are very grateful to Zoila and her family for giving us a place where we felt comfortable.&nbsp;&nbsp;We
        appreciate her dedication, nurturing, and effort with our son.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely, Zoila and her family
        helped us have a wonderful experience during our days in San Francisco.
        <br/><br/>
        We will keep these happy memories with us forever!

        When my oldest daughter was one year old in 2004 a friend of mine introduced me to My First Steps
        Daycare.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoila Chang took care of both my daughters until they were ready to go to
        preschool.&nbsp;&nbsp;She is an expert with babies, she follows a routine so the babies feel comfortable and
        know what to expect each day.&nbsp;&nbsp;She cooks very tasty and nutritional food each day that kids
        love.&nbsp;&nbsp;They also have a lot of toys and activities for kids all ages.&nbsp;&nbsp;My First Steps
        Daycare is a small, friendly, family oriented daycare, where all the families gather each year to celebrate
        B-days and special events.
        <br/>
        I would recommend My First Steps Daycare to anybody.

        The search for infant care started when I was 7 months pregnant.&nbsp;&nbsp;By San Francisco standards,
        this
        was pretty late and I was starting to panic.

        The search for infant care started when I was 7 months pregnant.&nbsp;&nbsp;By San Francisco standards,
        this
        was pretty late and I was starting to panic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Until that point, I was more focused on reading
        every
        prenatal book and taking every pre-natal class available.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was time to focus on after the
        baby's arrival.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had phone screened several places and toured 3 other home daycares that
        were
        passable.&nbsp;&nbsp;But once I met Zoila, I immediately knew we found the right place for our
        daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her home felt like a home-away-from-home and she had a gentle, confident way about her
        that I felt we would be partnering with a pro.&nbsp;&nbsp;This first foray in trusting maternal instincts
        was
        not wrong.
        <br/><br/>
        Being a new parent has had its challenges, but having our daughter at Zoila's has undoubtedly eased the
        process.&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming into parenthood as what many describe as 'your most rewarding and most
        difficult job' as an absolute amateur with little family around us was daunting.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time
        our daughter started at Zoila's at 5 months old, it felt like the equivalent of having the Michael
        Jordan
        of childcare and parenting join our team to guide us and show us the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;She had already gone to
        the 'championships' so many times in successfully raising her own children and taking care of so
        many
        other children.
        <br/><br/>
        Zoila has been a rock--constant and reliable--for which we are so grateful.&nbsp;&nbsp;As difficult as it
        was
        to return to work full-time, I could trust her implicitly and not have to worry about my daughter being well
        cared for.&nbsp;&nbsp;She was instrumental in encouraging me to keep pumping during year one.&nbsp;&nbsp;
        Without her introduction to a wide array of wholesome foods, it would have been near impossible for 2
        exhausted full-time working parents to now have an adventurous eater who goes for the vegetables without
        prompting.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her introduction to the world of puzzles, books, music, outdoor play and potty
        training
        has been outstanding.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention her leadership and guidance in cooperation, conflict
        resolution, rule-following, etiquette, and encouraging a community among parents that has been so enriching
        to
        our daughter and our lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will always look back on these early years and thoughts of Zoila
        will not be far in how she helped us along the journey.

        We looked at several child care options when we needed to find full-time care for our then-6-month-old
        son.&nbsp;&nbsp;And we were so happy when we found Zoila's daycare — it stood out in so many ways.
        <br/><br/>
        Zoila takes a whole-hearted approach to her job of caring for children.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some family daycares are
        just a basement room with some toys, but Zoila's entire house is set up for the kids — so they can play
        in
        the living room, and eat at the dining room table, and have fun in the toy room downstairs, and explore the
        backyard.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zoila has high-quality, developmentally appropriate toys and books in every space where
        the children play.&nbsp;&nbsp;She prepares amazing home-cooked, organic, healthy, and delicious meals for
        the
        kids, and encourages them to try new foods — which they're happy to do because everything is so tasty!
        She
        has a strong routine for the kids that includes a balance of play time, meal time, and quiet time, which
        enables the children to feel comfortable and know what to expect.&nbsp;&nbsp;She pays attention to each
        child's interests and strengths, and she teaches them to respect and care for each other — so that when
        our son was a toddler, his 3-year-old friend looked out for him, and now that our son is the big 3-year-old,
        he looks out for the babies.
        <br/><br/>
        Zoila's is so much more than just a daycare — it really is an extended family.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our son has
        strong friendships with the other children there, who have all known each other since they were infants, and
        beyond that we know Zoila's family, she knows our family, and we know the parents and siblings of the
        other children too — as well as the families of many alumni, who keep coming back for the birthday parties
        and
        annual picnic that Zoila holds every year.&nbsp;&nbsp;A great family daycare!
